# Introduction
Welcome to the official [**Cryptic Graphics Repository**](https://github.com/cryptic-game/graphics). Here you have the opportunity to create **wallpapers**, **icons** and **music** for the **frontend development** that will later be used in the final game. We appreciate all the support that we can get, and if you are an artist, musician or just like to play around with visual stuff in your freetime, you are welcome to submit your contributions. If you're not quite sure what you should do or where to start, check out our [**todo list**](https://github.com/orgs/cryptic-game/projects/5).
# **Additional information**

-   All icons that you push, have to be in **svg** format with an adjusted **viewbox**.
    
-   Wallpapers should be in **full hd** resolution **(1920 x 1080)**.
    
-   Use [**this link**](https://material.io/design/) for design recommendations.
